# Phase-2-Project

Phase 2 Proposal

“FlatMap”


A one sentence description of your app:

In our app, FlatMap, users can select places where Flatiron students live, toggle whether they've been there, rate and comment on what the specific place is good for, and view it on a map.

A simple wireframe of your site:

Setup: 

Step 1: Fork the Repository

Go to the repository: Navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork

Fork the repository: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

Step 2: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal: You can use any terminal application of your choice.

Clone the repository: Copy the URL of the forked repository from your GitHub account and run the following command in the terminal: 

git clone <your-forked-repo-url>

Replace <your-forked-repo-url> with the actual URL of your forked repository.

Step 3: Open the Project in VS Code

Navigate to the project directory: Change into the directory of your cloned repository by running:

cd <your-repo-name>

Replace <your-repo-name> with the name of your repository.

Open VS Code: Run the following command to open the project in Visual Studio Code:

code .

Step 4: Install Dependencies

Install dependencies: Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies for the project:

npm install

Step 5: Run the Server and Load the Page

Open two terminal windows: You’ll need to open separate terminal windows or tabs for running the server and starting the application.

Start the server: In the first terminal window, run the server using:

npm run server

Ensure that the server is running on http://localhost:4000/places.

Start the application: In the second terminal window, navigate to the project directory if you haven’t already, and run:

npm start

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Step 6: Verify the Setup

Check the browser: Once both the server and the application are running, check your browser to ensure the page loads correctly. You should be able to access the application interface and interact with it.
